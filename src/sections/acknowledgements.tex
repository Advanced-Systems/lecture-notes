\section{Acknowledgements}

\begin{flushleft}
	In this section of the draft I would like to express my very great appreciation
	to Dr. Aviv Censor from the Israel Institute of Technology, Prof. Jhevon Smith
	from the Mathematics department at Fordham University and Prof. David Massey
	from the Northeastern University. This document would not have been possible
	without their lectures whose recordings they made accessible to a public audience
	on YouTube. Additional references are listed in the bibliography.

	The \hyperref[sec-lina]{first} section closely follows Dr. Aviv Censor's
	(linear) algebra lecture\cite{algebraCensor2015}. The \hyperref[sec-analysis]{second}
	and \hyperref[sec-single-var-calc]{third} section are a combination of Dr. Aviv
	Censor's \cite{calc1Censor2015} and Prof. David Massey's lectures on single
	variable calculus. Building on this, the \hyperref[sec-multi-var-calc]{fourth}
	section is a transcription of Prof. Jhevon Smith's \cite{vectorCalcSmith2018}
	lecture series on multi-variable calculus.
